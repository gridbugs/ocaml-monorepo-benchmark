# Custom Overlays Upstreaming Status

Each of these opam packages are modified via the custom-overlays repo (inside
the directory custom-overlays). This was a quick fix to get the dune monorepo
benchmark working quickly, but the changes introduced in these overlays should
either be ustreamed to their original packages, or added to the
[opam-overlays](https://github.com/dune-universe/opam-overlays.git) repo.
